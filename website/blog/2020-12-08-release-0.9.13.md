Bueno!

We're making big steps towards PHP 8!

In this release, apart from some cool features, we're deprecating [`Match`], since
PHP8 brings new [`match`](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/match_expression_v2) keyword, and 
on PHP8 [`Match`] is a parse error. Since now, you whould be using [`Detail`] instead.

We're in a process of rewriting our documentation with the changes and suggestions to use [`Detail`] now.

From now on, the first couple of versions include deprecated [`Match`], as well
as new [`Detail`], so there's some time to update. We'd wish to keep the deprecation
forever, to keep backwards compatibility but that's impossible! :/ There's an ugly ultimatum.

We can either:
 - Keep [`Match`], deprecated or not; only on PHP7
 - Run it on PHP8, but without [`Match`]

We can't declare [`Match`] for backwards compatibility, because then we couldn't run it on PHP8. So once
we start supporting PHP8, we stop supporting deprecated [`Match`]. We're sorry there's no other way
around. 

In the future, we'll release version `0.10.0`, and it will support PHP8 fully; but there
will no longer be [`Match`], only [`Detail`].

As always, everything is described in [ChangeLog.md] on GitHub.
