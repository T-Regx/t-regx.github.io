title: Documentation in source code
author: Daniel Wilkowski

We're working very hard on trying to bring T-Regx 1.0 to our users, 
and there is very little yet to be finished.

The biggest thing that's coming is documentation in the source code
of the library in the form of PhpDoc comments. It will be complementary
documentation to the api reference on [t-regx.com](https://t-regx.com/),
but will be much easier to use and probably more helpful to the programmers.
We plan the documentation to be long and detailed - our aim is to provide a
documentation that fill be sufficient for day-to-day development, that 
doesn't require the developer to search for other sources in the browser,
but can find many answers right in the method signature and PhpDoc.

We indent to include tags `@param`, `@return` and `@throws` for the programming
part, as well as `@see` and `@link` pointing to the necessary documentation
for further reading.

Stay tuned!
