So over 2 months have passed since the last blog entry - much have changed. It's all described in
[ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/blob/develop/ChangeLog.md) on github, so there's no reason for rewriting
it again.

One big change is [`Prepared Patterns`](/docs/prepared-patterns) - which lets you handle user input or unsafe characters
in your patterns. It's got a dedicated section in [Docs](/docs/prepared-patterns), too.

Except for that, there's a discussion section in [Help](/help) - feel free to ask questions or propose features!
