title: Introduction to T-Regx
---

T-Regx provides clean API for regular expressions, as well as solving more complicated
issues with PHP regex (like eliminating false positives, validating groups) and including
features utterly missing in PHP: Prepared patterns, composite patterns, built-alteration
and more, as well as removing uncertainty with false negatives and false positives.

## Entry points

We have multiple entry methods to create `Pattern`, each with its own use case:
 - Standard pattern - `Pattern::of('\d+')`
 - Prepared patterns - to safely use user data in patterns (see [Prepared Patterns](handling-user-input.md))
 - Pattern lists - `Pattern::list(['\d+', '[a-z]+'])` to use many patterns at once
 - Literal string value - `Pattern::literal('[]?')` (identical to `Pattern::of('\[\]\?')`)

Additionally, compatibility API remains available, which accepts delimiters
 - Compatibility legacy - `PcrePattern::of('/\d+/m')` to use vanilla patterns

### Standard pattern

```php
use TRegx\CleanRegex\Pattern;
 
Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+')->test($subject);
```

Additionally, as a convenience method, `pattern()` global function is just an alias for `Pattern::of()`.

```php
pattern('/[A-Z]#[a-z]+')->test($subject);
```

### T-Regx prepared patterns

With `Pattern::inject()` placeholder `@` is being injected with the literal value of figures pass
as the second argument of `Pattern::inject()`.

```php
use TRegx\CleanRegex\Pattern;

/**
 * Example of prepared patterns
 */
$pattern = Pattern::inject('^\d+:@$', [$_GET['user']]);

/**
 * Test your pattern against subject "14:mark"
 */
$pattern->test('14:mark'); // true, if $_GET['user'] == 'mark'
```

You can learn more about prepared patterns in [Prepared Patterns](prepared-patterns.md).

### Pattern lists in T-Regx

Using `Pattern::list()` results an instance of `PatternList`, which contains the list of the patterns.
`PatternList` exposes multiple methods which act on the list of patterns. It is preferable to call
`PatternList.testAny()` instead of calling `Pattern.test()` in a loop, since `PatterList` will use
performance optimisations.

```php
<?php

/**
 * @var PatternList $patternList
 */
$patternList = Pattern::list([
    '\d+',
    '[a-z]+'
]);

/**
 * Check if any of the pattern matches the subject
 */
$patternList->testAny($_GET['input']);
```

`Pattern:list()` also accepts instances of `Pattern`. Any T-Regx method that instantiates `Pattern`
can be used with `Pattern::list()`.

```php
<?php

/**
 * @var PatternList $patternList
 */
$patternList = Pattern::list([
    '\d+',
    Pattern::of('\d+'),
    Pattern::inject(':?@', ['value']),
    PcrePattern::of('/[a-z]+/')
]);
```

Passing `string` into `Pattern::list()` ins the same as passing that very same string in `Pattern::of()` before
adding it to the list.

`PatternList` cannot contain other instances of `PatternList`.

You can learn more about `Pattern::list()` in [Multiple patterns].

## Deliberate delimiters

If `pattern()` or `Pattern::of()` is used with a delimited pattern, then characters `"/"` will simply be treated literally

```php
<?php
pattern('/[A-Z]/'); // matches characters "/", a letter and "/"
```

### Old-school patterns

Delimited patterns are still supported for completeness with flags, with `PcrePattern::of()`. Both versions are equal with each other.

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('[A-Z]+', 'im');
$pattern = PcrePattern::of('/[A-Z]+/im');

$pattern->test($subject)
```
