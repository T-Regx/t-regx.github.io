Before you engage in this article, please visit [Handling user input](handling-user-input.md) first,
if you're interested in using unsafe data in your patterns :)

```php
Pattern::inject("(My|Our) dog's name is @!", [$input]);
```

Suggested articles:
 - [`Pattern::inject()`]
 - `Pattern::template()`

Building your own patterns can be dangerous and lead to security errors. T-Regx offers a rich variety of
dedicated builders including [`Pattern::inject()`] and `Pattern::template()`.

## Procedural quoting - be careful

There are two methods `preq::quote()` and `preg::unquote()`.

First of which works as [`preg_quote()`] is supposed to work (except for the fact that [`preg_quote()`] is broken
before PHP 7.1.3).

<CodeTabs tregx="preg::quote('Welcome\How are you?');"/>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(0)}-->
<Result text>Welcome\\How are you\?</Result>

...second of which is the direct opposite:

<CodeTabs tregx="preg::unquote('Welcome\\How are you\?');"/>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(0)}-->
<Result text>Welcome\How are you?</Result>

Please, keep in mind that this **is not** a safe way to create patterns with unsafe characters - for that, consider
using [Prepared Patterns](prepared-patterns.md).

### Contract

These two methods should be transitive, so:

```php
// when
$output = preg::unquote(preg::quote($input));

// then
$this->assertEquals($input, $output); 
```

The contract is that `$input` should be identical to `$output` for any `string` value.
