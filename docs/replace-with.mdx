import {CodeTabs, Result} from './code';

After `replace()`, you need to explicitly use one of [`first()`]/[`all()`]/[`only(int)`] methods, to express how many
replacements should be done.

Specifying limits is done to relieve you from [**brain strain**] - so you can immediately
recognize author's intentions.

## Limits

Using [`first()`]/[`all()`]/[`only(int)`] is semantically identical to passing `$limit` argument to
[`preg_replace()`]/[`preg_replace_callback()`].

### First occurrence - [`first()`]

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
pattern('[A-Z][a-z]+')->replace($subject)->first()->with('___');`}
    php={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
preg_replace('/[A-Z][a-z]+/', '___', $subject, 1);`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{return-at(last)}-->
<!--PHP:{return-at(last)}-->
<Result>'I like scandinavia: ___, Norway and Denmark'</Result>

### All occurrences - `all()`

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
pattern('[A-Z][a-z]+')->replace($subject)->all()->with('___');`}
    php={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
preg::replace('/[A-Z][a-z]+/', '___', $subject);`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{return-at(last)}-->
<!--PHP:{return-at(last)}-->
<Result>'I like scandinavia: ___, ___ and ___'</Result>

### Limited occurrences - `only()`

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
pattern('[A-Z][a-z]+')->replace($subject)->only(2)->with('___');`}
    php={`$subject = 'I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark';\n
preg::replace('/[A-Z][a-z]+/', '___', $subject, 2);`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{return-at(last)}-->
<!--PHP:{return-at(last)}-->
<Result>'I like scandinavia: ___, ___ and Denmark'</Result>

Read on, to learn more about replacing with [a callback](replace-callback.mdx).

## Regular expression references

Normally, had you passed a replacement to [`preg_replace()`], that contains a backslash or a dollar sign followed by a
number (eg. `\1` or `$2`) - that reference would be replaced by a corresponding capturing group (or by an empty string,
if the group wasn't matched).

```php
preg::replace('/(\d+)cm/', '<$1>', 'I have 15cm and 192cm');
```

```text
I have <15> and <192>
```

Resolving such references won't happen using `with()`.

This is done to relieve you from the [**brain strain**]. A programmer should be able to merely
replace a string with a constant value without [cognitive load] about possible `\` or `$` hiding somewhere.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`pattern('(\\d+)cm')->replace('I have 15cm and 192cm')->all()->with('<$1>');`}
    php={`preg::replace('/(\\d+)cm/', '<\\$1>', 'I have 15cm and 192cm');
//                            ↑
// in T-Regx, special function is used to quote all references`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(first)}-->
<!--PHP:{echo-at(first)}-->
<Result text>{`I have <$1> and <$1>`}</Result>

You can be sure, what's put into `with()` will certainly be present unchanged in your final result.

Some replacement strings containing a backslash or a dollar sign (like file system paths, URL addresses or even user input)
might interfere with logic and cause bugs that are very hard to find.

:::note
Neither of types of references are resolved: `$12`, `\12` nor `${12}`.

## PHP-style intentional references

If you, however, would like to intentionally use regular expression references and have validated your input
against _an unexpected_ `\` or `$` - feel free to use `withReferences()` which **will** resolve replacement references.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`pattern('(\\d+)cm')->replace('I have 15cm and 192cm')->all()->withReferences('<$1>');`}
    php={`preg::replace('/(\\d+)cm/', '<$1>', 'I have 15cm and 192cm');
//                            ↑
// using withReferences(), back references are preserved`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(first)}-->
<!--PHP:{echo-at(first)}-->
<Result text>{`I have <15> and <192>`}</Result>

However, this is not recommended. For that, try using [`replace()->callback()`].

The only valid use-cases for `withReferences()` is:
 - Performance (since `withReferences()` uses [`preg_replace()`], and not [`preg_replace_callback()`])
 - Migration from `preg_replace()` used in legacy codebase

:::note
Using `withReferences()` is not recommended, since it exposes part of PHP regexps API, and
isn't actually part of T-Regx. Instead, try using `with()` or `callback()`.

We don't encourage its usage, but we're keeping it nonetheless, to allow users to decide for
themselves whether they want to use T-Regx API, or stay with PHP replace style.

## Remove occurrence

There are times when you'd like to simply remove the occurrence of a pattern from your subject. To do that,
use `pattern()->prune()` instead of `pattern()->replace()`:

<CodeTabs
  tregx={`pattern('[cm]m')->prune('I have 15cm and 192cm');`}
  php={`preg::replace('/[cm]m/', '', 'I have 15cm and 192cm');`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(first)}-->
<!--PHP:{echo-at(first)}-->
<Result text>{`I have 15 and 192`}</Result>

It's actually identical to calling `replace()->with('')` under the hood, but it's a bit shorter and more expressive.
