Matching a first occurrence in a string is the most common use-case.

## About `first()`

You can get the first occurrence of a pattern in a subject by calling `first()`.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`pattern('[0-9]+')->search("I'm 19 years old")->first();`}
    php={`if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm 19 years old", $match)) {
    return $match[0];\n}\nthrow new SubjectNotMatchedException();`}/>
<Result>'19'</Result>

:::note
If you would like to control the subject that **isn't matched** with your pattern though;
you can do it **explicitly** with [`findFirst()`](#findfirst) (and [`orReturn()`], [`orElse()`], [`orThrow()`]).

### Match details

With [`Detail`] and `match()`, you can gain access to useful information about the matched occurrence.

<CodeTabs
tregx={`$detail = pattern('\\w+')->match("Apples are cool")->first();
// highlight-next-line
$subject = $detail->subject();
echo "Match '$detail' was matched inside '$subject'.";`}
    php={`$subject = "Apples are cool";
if (preg::match('/\\w+/', $subject, $match)) {
    $text = $match[0];
    echo "Match '$text' was matched inside '$subject'.";
} 
else {
    throw new SubjectNotMatchedException();
}`}/>
<Result text>Match 'Apples' was matched inside 'Apples are cool'.</Result>

You can read more extensively about it on [`Detail`] page.

### Groups in match

Retrieving capturing groups from a match is really simple.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`$detail = pattern('(?<capital>[A-Z])')->match('hello there, General Kenobi')->first();
// highlight-next-line
return $detail->get('capital');`}
    php={`if (preg::match('~(?<capital>[A-Z])[a-z]+~', 'hello there, General Kenobi', $match)) {
    // highlight-next-line
    return $match['capital'][0];\n}
throw new SubjectNotMatchedException();`}/>

<!--T-Regx:{return-at(0)}-->
<Result>'G'</Result>

:::note
You can learn more about groups on [Capturing Group](match-groups.md) page.
