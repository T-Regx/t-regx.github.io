import {Result} from './code';

Matching a first occurrence in a string is the most common use-case.

## About `first()`

You can get the first occurrence of a pattern in a subject by calling `first()`.
```php
pattern('[0-9]+')->search("I'm 19 years old")->first();
```
<Result>'19'</Result>

### Match details

With [`Detail`] and `match()`, you can gain access to useful information about the matched occurrence.

```php
$detail = pattern('\w+')->match("Apples are cool")->first();
// highlight-next-line
$subject = $detail->subject();
echo "Match '$detail' was matched inside '$subject'.";
```
<Result text>Match 'Apples' was matched inside 'Apples are cool'.</Result>

You can read more extensively about it on [`Detail`] page.

### Groups in match

Retrieving capturing groups from a match is really simple.

```php
$detail = pattern('(?<capital>[A-Z])')->match('hello there, General Kenobi')->first();
// highlight-next-line
return $detail->get('capital');
```
<Result>'G'</Result>
