Use `Pattern.replace()` to perform regular expression search and replace.

## Replacing with a constant value

To replace occurrences of a regular expression pattern in a given subject, use `Pattern.replace()` to
instantiate a `Replace` operation for the subject and `.with()` to replace the ocurrence with a constant
`string` value.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$pattern = Pattern::of('\w{4,}', 'i');

// instantiate a replace operation
$replace = $pattern->replace('Some of these words are longer');

// perform regular expression search and replace
$output = $replace->with('XXX');  // (string) "XXX of XXX XXX are XXX"
```

`Replace.with()` returns a new string with content of the subject, but with occurrences of a
regular expression replaced by a given `string` argument.

If the pattern doesn't match the subject at all, `.with()` returns the subject unmodified.

### Replacing with an empty string

While it is possible to call `Replace.with()` with an empty string `""` to remove the occurrences,
it's more semantic to call `Pattern.prune()`.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$pattern = Pattern::of('\w{4,}', 'i');

// using Replace.with()   ðŸ—™ 
$replace = $pattern->replace('Some of these words are longer');
$output = $replace->with('');  // replace with an empty string

// using Pattern.prune()  âœ“ 
$output = $pattern->prune('Some of these words are longer');
```

## Replace with a group

Method `Replace.withGroup()` can be used to replace occurrences of a regular expression in the
subject with a capturing group of the expression. To replace the occurrence of regular expression
in the subject with a capturing group, pass an ordinal number of the group as the first argument 
of `Replace.withGroup()`.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern with a capturing group
$domainPattern = Pattern::of('www\.([\w.-]+)', 'i');

// instantiate a replace operation
$replace = $domainPattern->replace('I have a link: www.google.com and www.t-regx.com');

// replace domain with just the top level domain
$output = $replace->withGroup(1);  // (string) "I have a link: google.com and t-regx.com"
```

The regular expression `www.([\w.-]+)` matches substring `"www.google.com"`, in which 
the capturing group `1` captures `"google.com"`. Replacement operation is invoked using `withGroup(1)`, 
and so the matched occurrence is replaced by the content of the capturing group. The second
occurrence of the matched pattern is `"www.t-regx.com"`, in which the first capturing group 
captures `"t-regx.com"`.

Method `Replace.withGroup()` accepts `int|string`. With argument of type `int` passed, the capturing
group is referred to by an ordinal number, commonly known as *"group index"*. Capturing groups are 
ordered by their opening parenthesis. For example: in pattern `(Cat)(Foo(Bar))`, group `(Cat)` is 
assigned an ordinal number `1`, group `(Foo(Bar))` is assigned an ordinal number `2`, and group `(Bar)` 
is assigned an ordinal number `3`.

Because the matched occurrence is always implicitly captured and is assigned an ordinal number `0`, 
call `Replace.withGroup(0)` performs a somewhat redundant search and replace, because it returns the 
subject unmodified, as the matched occurrence is replaced by itself.

### Named groups

Method `Replace.withGroup()` accepts `int|string`. With argument of type `string` passed, the capturing
group is referred to by its group name. Not all capturing groups are named, for example group `(Foo)` 
is not a named group.

Explicit syntax is available for named groups: `(?<###>...)`, where `###` is the name of the group, 
for example: `(?<capital>[A-Z])[a-z]+)`. Alternative syntax for named group is `(?P<###>...)` or `(?'###'...)`.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern with a named capturing group
$domainPattern = Pattern::of('(?<capital>[A-Z])[a-z]{2,})');

// instantiate a replace operation
$replace = $domainPattern->replace('My name is Mark, and his name is John');

// replace names with their capital letters
$output = $replace->withGroup('capital');  // (string) "My name is M, and his name is J"
```

Named capturing groups can be referred to either by ordinal numbers or by the name. In pattern 
`(?<capital>[A-Z])[a-z]{2,})`, the first group can be used to replace the occurrence either 
using `withGroup(1)` or `withGroup('capital')`. In other words, all capturing groups are assigned 
an ordinal number, but only named groups can be referred to by their name.

Additionally, modifier `/n` can be used when instantiating `Pattern` by passing `Pattern::NO_AUTOCAPTURE`
or by simply passing `string` literal `'n'` .

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('(https?://)?(?<domain>[\w.]+)', Pattern::NO_AUTOCAPTURE);
$pattern = Pattern::of('(https?://)?(?<domain>[\w.]+)', 'n');
```

Because modifier `Pattern::NO_AUTOCAPTURE` is used in `$pattern`, only the named groups are 
captured, and so group `(https?://)` is not captured. In this case `(?<domain>[\w.]+)` is 
captured and is assigned an ordinal number `1`. 

In patterns without modifier `'n'` - `Pattern::NO_AUTOCAPTURE`, syntax `(?:...)` can be 
used to add a non-capturing group.

### Unmatched group

Method `Replace.withGroup()` throws `GroupNotMatchedException` when replacement is attempted with
an unmatched group.

In example below, group `(http://)` is followed by `?`. Such group may not be matched, while the
whole pattern matches. Such groups are referred to as *"optional groups"*, because for different 
subjects they may or may not be matched.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$domainPattern = Pattern::of('(http://)?www.[\w.-]+');

// instantiate a replace
$replace = $domainPattern->replace('I have a link: www.google.com and www.t-regx.com');

// try to replace with an unmatched group
$output = $replace->withGroup(1);  // (GroupNotMatchedException): Expected to replace with group #1, but the group was not matched
```

### Nonexistent group

Method `Replace.withGroup()` throws `NonexistentGroupException` when replacement is attempted with
a group that is not present in the pattern.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$domainPattern = Pattern::of('(http://)?www.[\w.]+');

// instantiate a replace
$replace = $domainPattern->replace('subject');

// try to replace with a nonexistent group
$output = $replace->withGroup(3);          // (NonexistentGroupException): Nonexistent group: #3
$output = $replace->withGroup('missing');  // (NonexistentGroupException): Nonexistent group: 'missing'
```

In fact, any operation on a missing group apart from `.groupExists()` throws `NonexistentGroupException`.

## Replace with a callback

Method `Replace.callback()` performs a regular expression search, passes the flow control back 
to the caller via `callable`, which accepts a matched occurrence as `Detail` argument, and then 
performs replacement with the values returned from the `callable`. Each matched occurrence of the 
regular expression in the subject is replaced by `string` value returned from the `callable`. In 
other words, `Replace.callback()` accepts a `callable`, which is supposed to map the received 
`Detail` argument to a new `string` replacement.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$pattern = Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+'); 

// instantiate a replace
$replace = $pattern->replace('I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark');

// replace occurrences with a callback
$replace->callback(fn (Detail $match) => \strToUpper($match->text())); 
  // (string) "I like scandinavia: SWEDEN, NORWAY and DENMARK"
```

### Matched occurrence

The matched occurrence of the regular expression in the subject is passed as an argument 
to the `callable` argument of `Replace.callback()`.

The matched occurrence is passed as `Detail`, which is the same interface as the one 
representing the matched occurrence in `Pattern.match()`, for example `Matcher.first()`.

All of the implementation differences between internal structures of matching and replacing
are unified under the common `Detail` interface.

### Accepted return values

Argument `callable` passed to `Replace.callback()` can only return `string`, which is the
new replacement.

When value of type other than `string` is returned from the `callable`, then `Replace.callback()`
throws `InvalidReplacementException`.

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+');
$replace = $pattern->replace('I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark');

$replace->callback(function (Detail $match): int {
    return 2;
});
  // (InvalidReplacementException): Invalid callback() callback return type. Expected string, but integer (2) given
```

### `Stringable` return values

Note, that objects implementing `Stringable` or objects with `__toString()` are also invalid.

Received argument `Detail` can be cast to `string`, which is the same as calling `Detail.text()`;
but returning object of type `Detail` or any other `Stringable` object throws 
`InvalidReplacementException`.

```php
$replace->callback(function (Detail $match): Detail {
    $match->text();  // (string) "Sweden"
    (string) $match; // (string) "Sweden"

    return $match;
});
    // (InvalidReplacementException): Invalid callback() callback return type. Expected string, but...
```

To conveniently return object of type `Detail` or other `Stringable` type, specify PHP `string`
type-hint on the anonymous function or explicitly cast the object to `string`.

```php
$replace->callback(function (Detail $match) {
    return (string) $match; // explicit cast to string
});
```

```php
$replace->callback(function (Detail $match): string { // PHP "string" type-hint
    return $match;
});
```

Specify `string` type-hint, so that PHP can implicitly cast the object to `string`, 
or omit the type-hint and allow `Replace.callback()` to validate the type of the return values,
in case the returned value is of other type.

### PHP callable notation

In PHP, certain `string` and `array` values are also `callable`. 

- `'strToUpper'`, `'strToLower'` - a `callable` that behaves similarly to global `strToUpper()` and `strToLower()` functions
- `[$this, 'replace']` - a `callable` tht behaves similarly to a method `.replace()` on `$this`

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$pattern = Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+'); 

// instantiate a replace
$replace = $pattern->replace('I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark');

// replace occurrences with a callback
$replace->callback('strToUpper'); // (string) "I like scandinavia: SWEDEN, NORWAY and DENMARK"
```

Function `strToUpper()` accepts `string` as argument, and so when `callback('strToUpper')` is called,
the `Detail` is passed as an argument to `strToUpper()`. Because `strToUpper()` accepts `string`, then
`Detail` is being cast to `string`, which is the same as calling `Detail.text()`.

In PHP, an array `[$this, 'replace']` is also a valid `callable`.

```php
class HelloWorld {
    public function run() {
        // Instantiate a pattern
        $pattern = Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+'); 
        
        // instantiate a replace
        $replace = $pattern->replace('I like scandinavia: Sweden, Norway and Denmark');
        
        // replace occurrences with a callback
        $replace->callback([$this, 'replace']); // (string) "I like scandinavia: SWEDEN, NORWAY and DENMARK"
    }

    private function replace(Detail $match): string {
        return \strToUpper($match->text());
    }
}
```

Notice, that `Replace.callback()` truly accepts `callable` as argument type. However, in PHP certain 
values are also regarded as callable, for instance the aforementioned `"strToUpper"` or 
`[$this, 'replace']`.

## Replace with references

Method `Replace.withReferences()` can be used to pass a formatting string to PCRE, which is an internal
implementation of T-Regx and other regular expression methods in PHP.

`Replace.withReferences()` is listed last, as this is the least recommended mean of replacing elements. 
Please, try and use `.with()`, `.withGroup()` or `.callback()` first, and only use `.withReferences()` 
as the last resort.

```php
// Instantiate a pattern
$domainPattern = Pattern::of('(?:(https?)://)?www.[\w.-]+');

// instantiate a replace
$replace = $domainPattern->replace('I have a link: https://www.google.com and www.t-regx.com');

// replace with a formatting string
$output = $replace->withReferences('<scheme:$1>'); // (string) "I have a link: <scheme:https> and <scheme:>"
```

Method `Replace.withReferences()` replaces the matched occurrences with the formatting string, 
with certain tokens populated by captured groups, for example: `$1`.

Special tokens in formatting string:

- `$` and a capturing group ordinal number: `$1`, `$2` and also `$0`
- `\` and a capturing group ordinal number: `\1`, `\2` and also `\0`
- `${`, a group ordinal number and a closing `}`: `${1}`, `${2}` and also `${0}`

Please, be advised that `Replace.withReferences()` is discouraged, because of a number of reasons:

- Formatting string tokens use special characters which can be mistaken for PHP language syntax (e.g. for example
  format token `\1` can be mistaken for PHP notation of `chr(1)`)
- Unmatched groups are simply ignored, and implicitly replaced by an empty string `""`, which may or may not be desired
- Nonexistent groups are ignored, which can lead to hard to find bugs
- Formatting string can't be used to reference capturing groups by names
- Is a tight dependency on internal PCRE format

For these reasons we recommend using `.with()`, `.withGroup()` and `.callback()`.
