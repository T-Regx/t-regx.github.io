import {Result} from './code';

Using `pattern()->replace()` you can:

- Limit replacements with:
  - `replace()->first()`
  - `replace()->all()`
  - `replace()->only(int)`
- replace with a constant value - [`with()`](replace-with.mdx)/[`withReferences()`](replace-with.mdx)
- replace with a computed value - [`callback()`](replace-callback.mdx)
- handle subjects that don't match the pattern for replacements - `otherwise()`/`throwingOtherwise()`/`returningOtherwise()`

## Limiting replacements

After `replace()`, you need to explicitly use one of `first()`/`all()`/`only(int)` methods, to express how many
replacements should be done.
```php
$subject = "I'm 19, I have 192cm and I was born in 1999";
pattern('\d+')->replace($subject)->first()->with("___");
pattern('\d+')->replace($subject)->only(2)->with("___");
pattern('\d+')->replace($subject)->all()->with("___");
```
<Result>
{`"I'm ___, I have 192cm and I was born in 1999"
"I'm ___, I have ___cm and I was born in 1999"
"I'm ___, I have ___cm and I was born in ___"`}
</Result>
