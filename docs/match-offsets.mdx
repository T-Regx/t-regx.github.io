import {Result} from './code';

There are several ways to read offsets of your matched occurrences and your capturing groups.

## Using [`Detail`]

If you use [`Detail`] object (like the one passed to [`forEach()`] or [`map()`] callback) you can just use
[`offset()`] method.

```php
$detail = pattern('\d+')->match('I was born in 1996')->first();
return 'Match was found at ' . $detail->offset();
```
<Result>'Match was found at 14'</Result>

Method [`offset()`] is UTF-8 safe and returns offsets in characters, not bytes.
For bytes, consider using [`byteOffset()`] method. Use [`offset()`] with multibyte-safe methods like [`mb_substr()`], and [`byteOffset()`] with methods like [`substr()`].

### Using [`Detail`]

```php
$detail = pattern('(?<capital>[A-Z])[a-z]+')->match('my name is John Cena')->first();
return $detail->group('capital')->offset();
```
<Result>11</Result>
