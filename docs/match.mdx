Documentation for version: 0.41.2

Matching a subject with regular expressions is the most frequent usage of T-Regx.

## Predication overview

Conditions on subject matching certain `Pattern` are the most common. Methods `Pattern.test(string)` and `Pattern.fails(string)`
can be used to determine whether a pattern matches the subject.

```php
$agePattern = Pattern::of('[0-9]{2,}');

$agePattern->test("I'm 19 years old");   // bool (true)
$agePattern->fails("I'm 19 years old");   // bool (false)
```

Methods `Pattern.test(string)` and `Pattern.fails(string)` throw `MalformedPatternExceptions`, should they be called for
a pattern with a malformed regular expression. Similarly to other T-Regx methods, `test()` and `fails()` throw
other kinds of appropriate exceptions, for instance `CatastrophicBacktrackingException` should the subject happen to be
too complex. Detailed reference to T-Regx exception handling is presented in the further chapters of the documentation.

## Matching overview

To match a subject, invoke `match(string)` on an instance of `Pattern` to receive the matcher.
Invocation of `match(string)` doesn't perform any regular expression search just yet.

```php
/**
 * Instantiate your pattern
 */
$pattern = Pattern::of('\d+');

/**
 * Receive the subject matcher
 */
$matcher = $pattern->match('I have 140 apples');
```

The detailed reference of `Matcher` functionalities is presented in the further chapters of the documentation.
For overview, `Matcher` interface consists of methods:

- Test a subject against a pattern: [`test()`]/[`fails()`]
- Retrieve matches from the subject: [`first()`]/[`all()`]/[`only(int)`]
- Get the matched capturing groups: [`Detail.get(int|string)`], [`Detail.group(int|string)`]

The complete `Matcher` reference is present in the further chapters of the documentation.

### Retrieve the first match

Method `Matcher.first()` can be used to perform a single regular expression match against
the subject.

```php
/**
 * Instantiate digit pattern
 */
$digitPattern = Pattern::of('[0-9]+');

/**
 * Receive matcher for the subject
 */
$matcher = $digitPattern->match("I'm 19 years old. I was born in 1999");

/**
 * Perform a single regular expression match
 */
$firstMatch = $matcher->first(); // object (Detail)
```

Instance of `Detail` represents the matched occurrence of the `Pattern` in the subject.
Methods `Detail.text()` and `Detail.offset()` can be used to read information about the
matched occurrence.

```php
/**
 * Read the whole matched occurrence
 */
$firstMatch->text();   // string ("19")

/**
 * Read the whole match as integer (in base 10)
 */
$firstMatch->toInt();  // int (19)

/**
 * Read the occurrence position in subject (in characters)
 */
$firstMatch->offset(); // int (4)
```

More information on [`first()`] is present in the [next chapter](match-first.mdx). Reference on [`Detail`]
can be found in ["Match detail"] chapter.

### Iterating multiple matches

Instance of `Matcher` is `\Iterable`, so it can be used directly in a `foreach` loop.

```php
/**
 * Instantiate digit pattern
 */
$digitPattern = Pattern::of('[0-9]+');

/**
 * Receive matcher for the subject
 */
$matcher = $digitPattern->match("I'm 22 years old. I was born in 1999, so the current year must be 2021 or 2022");

/**
 * Perform global regular expression search and iterate matches
 */
foreach ($matcher as $detail) {
  /**
   * Detail used in string interpolation is the same as using Detail.text()
   */
  echo "Match found is '$detail' at position " . $detail->offset() . PHP_EOL;
}

if ($matcher->fails()) {
  echo "Unfortunately, no occurrences of pattern were present in the subject";
} else {
  echo "In total, {$matcher->count()} occurrences found in the subject";
}
```

The example above iterates occurrences of `Pattern` in the subject, retrieving
the whole matches' values and their positions.

```plain
Match found is '22' at position 4
Match found is '1999' at position 32
Match found is '2021' at position 66
Match found is '2022' at position 74
In total, 4 occurrences found in the subject
```

Calling `Matcher.fails()` and `Matcher.count()` will not perform another global regular
expressions searches, if the search has already been invoked by iterating the `Matcher`.
In the example above `Matcher` is being iterated for occurrences of `Detail` in the subject,
thus T-Regx performs the global regular expression search, finding occurrences `['22', '1999', '2021', '2022']`.
Further call to `Matcher.fails()` uses the results from the iteration and returns `false` without
any additional search. `Matcher.count()` returns `4` immediately, using the number of occurrences
found from the previous iteration. Of course, iterating the same instance of `Matcher` again
will not perform unnecessary global search either. Further details about performance optimisations
in T-Regx are presented in the next chapters of the documentation.

### Retrieving multiple matches

Method `Matcher.all()` can also be used to perform global regular expression search. `Matcher.all()`
returns PHP `array`, precisely `Detail[]`.

```php
/**
 * Receive matcher for the subject
 */
$matcher = $digitPattern->match("I'm 22 years old. I was born in 1999, so the current year must be 2021 or 2022");

/**
 * Perform global regular expression search and return matches
 */
$details = $matcher->all(); // array ([Detail, Detail, Detail, Detail])

/**
 * Detail used in string interpolation is the same as using Detail.text()
 */
echo "Match found is '{$details[0]}' at position " . $detail->offset() . PHP_EOL;
```

Methods `Matcher.all()`, `Matcher.fails()` and `Matcher.count()` throw `MalformedPatternExceptions`, should
they be called for a pattern with a malformed regular expression. Similarly to other T-Regx
methods, `fails()`, `all()` and `count()` throw other kinds of appropriate exceptions, for
instance `CatastrophicBacktrackingException` should the subject happen to be too complex. Detailed reference
to T-Regx exception handling is presented in the further chapters of the documentation.
