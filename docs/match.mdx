title: Match a subject

import {Result} from './code';

Using `pattern()->match()` you can:
 - Test a subject against a pattern: [`test()`]/[`fails()`]
 - Retrieve matches from the subject: [`first()`]/[`all()`]/[`only()`]
 - Get capturing groups from matches: [`Detail.get()`], [`Detail.group()`]
 - Try functional approach: [`forEach()`]/[`map()`]/[`flatMap()`]

## Test a subject

If you only need to check whether a pattern matches a subject, use:
```php
pattern('[0-9]+')->test("I'm 19 years old");
```
...or to check whether it doesn't:
```php
pattern('[0-9]{3}')->fails("I'm 19 years old");
```
Of course `pattern()->match()` throws an exception if the pattern is invalid (or in case of any other error).

## Retrieve the first match

To get the first occurrence of a matched pattern, call [`first()`].

```php
pattern('[0-9]+')->search("I'm 19 years old. I was born in 1999")->first();
```
<Result>'19'</Result>

Read on the [next page](match-first.mdx) to learn more about [`first()`].

## Retrieve multiple matches

You can easily retrieve matched occurrences of a pattern in your subject.
```php
pattern('[0-9]+')->search("I'm 19. I was born in 1999, on May 12")->all();
```
<Result>['19', '1999', '12']</Result>

You can limit your matches with `only(int)`.
```php
pattern('[0-9]+')->search("I'm 19. I was born in 1999, on May 12")->only(2);
```
<Result>['19', '1999']</Result>
