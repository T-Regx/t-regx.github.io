title: Counting occurrences

Documentation for version: 0.41.2

In certain situations an amount of occurrences is desired, but not the occurrences themselves. 
In that case, it's recommended to consider `Pattern.count()`, instead of performing full matches
with `Matcher.all()`/`Search.all()`.

Method `Pattern.count()` accepts a `string` subject, and returns the number of occurrences of
the pattern in the subject.

```php
/*
 * Instantiate pattern
 */
$pattern = pattern('[aeiouy]');

/*
 * Count occurrences 
 */
$pattern->count('Computer');  // (int) 3
```

## Unmatched subjects

When `Pattern.count()` is called with a subject that doesn't match the pattern, 
then `count()` returns `0`.

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('[0-9]');
$pattern->count('Computer');  // (int) 0
```

## Malformed patterns

Every use of `pattern()`/`Pattern::of()` with an invalid pattern causes `MalformedPatternException`.

```php
try {
  pattern('[aeiouy')->count('Computer');  // malformed pattern
}
catch (MalformedPatternException $ex) {
  echo $ex->getMessage();  // 'Missing terminating ] for character class at offset 7'
}
```

## Number of occurrences in `Matcher`

Apart from `Pattern.count()`, methods `Matcher.count()` and `Search.count()` can also be used to 
retrieve the number of occurrences of the pattern in the subject.

```php
/*
 * Instantiate pattern
 */
$pattern = pattern('[aeiouy]');

/*
 * Instantiate the subject matcher
 */
$matcher = $pattern->match('Computer');

/*
 * Count occurrences 
 */
$matcher->count();  // (int) 3
```

Additionally, `Matcher` implements PHP interface [`\Countable`], and so can be used with PHP methods, 
such as `count()`:

```php
$pattern = pattern('[aeiouy]');
$matcher = $pattern->match('Computer');

count($matcher);  // (int) 3
```

## Performance predicating a subject

It might appear suitable to use `count()` to ascertain whether a given subject matches the
pattern, since `count()` doesn't return any matches.

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('[aeiouy]');
$count = $pattern->count('Computer');
return $count > 0;  // (bool) true
```

While that is true, that using `Pattern.count()` is more performant than `Matcher.all()`,
it still iterates all of the occurrences of the pattern in the subject. 

The recommended approach for such predication is with [`test()`]/[`fails()`]:

```php
$pattern = Pattern::of('[aeiouy]');
return $pattern->test('Computer');  // (bool) true
```

That's because `count()` goes through each occurrence of a pattern in the subject counting it,
whereas `test()` returns right after matching the first occurrence.
